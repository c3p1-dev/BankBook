# BankBook

BankBook will be a simple bank account manager, written in C# and Avalonia for a cross-platform and modern GUI.
As this software is designed for my own needs, I use SQLite for its simplicity and lightness.

BankBook requires you to create a local account. No data are collected in any way and BankBook only stores the Argon2 hash signature of your password.

BankBook is currently at a very early stage of its development.
