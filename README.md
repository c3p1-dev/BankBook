# BankBook

BankBook will be a simple bank account manager, written with C# and Avalonia for a cross-platform and modern GUI.
As this software is designed for my own needs, I use SQLite for its simplicity and lightness.

BankBook only manages one user per installation. The access to the software will be lockable with a PIN code.

BankBook is currently at a very early stage of its development.
